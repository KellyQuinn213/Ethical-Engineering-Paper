Ethical Engineering: Computational Persuasion for Positive Behavior Change
In the past few years both private and public sector companies and agencies have entered into discussion about or issued guidelines for ethics in artificial intelligence. While the global consensus agrees that ethics in artificial intelligence is of paramount importance, the notion of what exactly ethical artificial intelligence would look like remains unsatisfactorily defined. International organizations and corporations such as Google, SAP, Amnesty International, and the High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence as appointed by the European Union, to name a few, have been tasked or taken it upon themselves to draft such guidelines (Jobin et al., 2019). In many instances, these bodies have turned to classic theories of ethics and morality from Aristotle’s teleological arguments to Kant’s deontological (Chatila & Havens, 2019), but just as these historical figures could not have predicted this great dilemma of the 21st century, modern society is struggling to cope with the speed of innovation and technological advancement. One area in particular that is ripe for ethical dissertation is the development of persuasive technology and its uses on the influence the behavior and attitudes of the 21st century human being. Even when it may be for the greater good.
